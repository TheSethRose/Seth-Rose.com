GlideQuery is a modern, expressive, and safer interface to the Now platform. It's designed to catch mistakes early in the development cycle and behave more like a regular JavaScript API. It's a wrapper over GlideRecord, simplifying many queries and helping to avoid common performance issues without needing deeper knowledge of GlideRecord. 

## GlideQuery vs. GlideRecord: A Performance Perspective

While GlideQuery is a bit slower than GlideRecord, the difference in run times is not significant. However, the added value of GlideQuery lies in its ability to help reduce the lead time of implementation, even if it's not faster. 

## GlideQuery: A Safer Bet

GlideQuery is designed to prevent common pain points experienced during development. For instance, a performance bug using GlideRecord due to a misspelled field in an addQuery call could cause it to query far more records than intended. GlideQuery, with its stricter syntax, would catch such a bug before it reaches the customers. 

## GlideQuery in Action: Reading and Writing Examples

### Reading Data with GlideQuery
Imagine you need to group users by city and count them. GlideQuery makes this easy:

```javascript
new GlideQuery('sys_user')
    .aggregate('count')
    .groupBy('city')
    .select()
    .forEach(function (group) {
        gs.info(group.group.city + ' has ' + group.count + ' users');
    });
```
This example uses `aggregate` to count users and `groupBy` to group them by city, demonstrating how GlideQuery can simplify complex queries.

### Writing Data with GlideQuery
When adding a new user to the 'sys_user' table, GlideQuery's `insert` method is straightforward:

```javascript
new GlideQuery('sys_user')
    .insert({
        active: true,
        name: 'Sam Meylan',
        city: 'Geneva'
    })
    .get();
```
This snippet shows how to insert a new record and retrieve it immediately using `get`.

### Updating Data with GlideQuery
Updating an incident's priority is a common task, and GlideQuery handles it with ease:

```javascript
new GlideQuery('incident')
    .where('sys_id', id)
    .update({priority: 1});
```
Here, `where` selects the record, and `update` modifies the 'priority' field, showcasing GlideQuery's capability for updating records.

## Conclusion

While GlideQuery might not replace GlideRecord entirely, it offers an additional layer on top of it, reducing the likelihood of errors and mistakes when manipulating GlideRecord. It's a powerful tool within the ServiceNow platform that enables developers to perform advanced database queries with ease, leading to better insights, improved workflows, and enhanced decision-making.
