summary: Since late July, my life has taken an unexpected detour. Diagnosed with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), I’ve been propelled into a world where health takes precedence over everything else, reshaping my perspective and priorities. It’s a sobering reality that cancer sucks and indiscriminately intrudes on life's plans, stopping them in their tracks and reshuffling your priorities. It asks for a kind of strength that some days seems just out of reach. But this post isn't about giving up; it's about finding strength even when it seems just out of reach.

Since late July, my life has taken an unexpected detour. Diagnosed with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), I’ve been propelled into a world where health takes precedence over everything else, reshaping my perspective and priorities. It’s a sobering reality that cancer sucks and indiscriminately intrudes on life's plans, stopping them in their tracks and reshuffling your priorities. It asks for a kind of strength that some days seems just out of reach. But this post isn't about giving up; it's about finding strength even when it seems just out of reach.

Being away from the daily grind to focus on treatment and recovery, I've relied on the unwavering support of family, friends, and colleagues. Their support has provided the foundation I need to rest, which is especially necessary when the kids bring home every bug going around. On days when my health permits, I turn to my love for technology and tinkering, serving both as a distraction and a passion. It's a delicate balance, listening to my body's needs while engaging in activities that bring me joy. Keeping up with the fast pace of AI is a challenge, but these pursuits keep my mind sharp and my skills relevant.

DevStyleShop, my side project that combines AI's creativity with fashion, has recently taken a back seat. The exhaustion that comes with recovery can be overwhelming. Updating my own website and making small contributions to open-source projects, like during Hacktoberfest, count as personal victories. They symbolize my commitment to the craft and the developer community, despite the physical limitations I’m currently facing.

This post is a heartfelt expression of gratitude to all who have been with me on this unforeseen path. It reminds us that when life presents us with challenges, there's always a path forward, a solution to the problem, a bug to fix.
