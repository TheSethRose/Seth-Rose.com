## **The Scenario: Email Notifications for New User Account Creation**

Consider this: your IT team handles numerous user account creations daily. Keeping track of these in real time can be challenging. You want to set up an email notification for every time a new user account is created, detailing the account name and creation date.

## **Setting Up Automated Email Notifications in ServiceNow**

1. **Registering an Event in ServiceNow**
   - Navigate to the **event registry** (`sysevent_register`) in ServiceNow.
   - Create a new event by clicking **New**.
   - Name your event, linking it to the relevant user account table.
   - Set the trigger as a **business rule**.
   - Save your new event.

2. **Creating a Business Rule for Event Triggering**
   - Access the **Business Rule** (`sys_script`) table.
   - Create a new rule by selecting **New**.
   - Give your rule a name and connect it to the user account table.
   - Activate the rule and make it **Advanced**.
   - In the scripting area, add a code to trigger your event when a new account is created.

```javascript
(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {
    // Your custom code here
    gs.eventQueue('your.event.name', current, current.u_account_name, current.sys_created_on);
})(current, previous);
```

**Note:** Replace 'your.event.name' with your chosen event name.

3. **Configuring the Email Notification**
   - Locate the **Notifications** (`sysevent_email_action`) table.
   - Initiate a new notification with **New**.
   - Define the notification, selecting the user account table.
   - Set the trigger to **Event is fired**, linking it to your event.
   - Choose who will receive the notification and craft the message content.

## **Testing and Troubleshooting**

After setting up, it's crucial to test the notification system. Create a test user account and monitor your email for the notification. If issues arise, troubleshoot by checking your event and business rule configurations. Remember, accurate setup is key to reliable notifications.
