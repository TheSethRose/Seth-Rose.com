I’ve dedicated my career to aiding businesses in their digital transformation, leveraging technology for growth and valuing the essence of teamwork.

Outside of professional endeavors, I’m an avid gadget enthusiast, particularly Apple products, and I continuously expand my proficiency in Javascript, Python, and emerging AI technologies like Large Language Models (such as ChatGPT, Claude 2, etc).

I deeply value work-life balance, personal growth, and the power of collaboration in the IT realm.
